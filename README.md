# MapsToDo-Public

Maps To Do lets anyone plan and organize map jobs. Quickly measure the area, circumference, and distance on the map. Easily save to-do items, take notes, and photos of measurements. And with advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share photos and send files of measurements to family, friends, and co-workers. For further information, you may check its <a href="https://mapstodo.com/">website</a> or download it from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/maps-to-do/id1553502403">AppStore</a>. 

Maps To Do was designed and developed between Aug. 2020, and April 2021 by me. I keep private repo due to privacy matters like API Keys, and I have some unfinished features(codes) there. These days I plan to make some refactors on the current code and add some new features. This refactors and new developments may take time because of this is an side project for me. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsklc">Linkedin</a> or <a href="enes.kilic1@outlook.com">e-mail</a>.
